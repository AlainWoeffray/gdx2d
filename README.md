What is gdx2d ?
===============

*gdx2d* is a simple to use game and graphics framework. It is multi-platform (working on Windows, Linux and Android). It is Java based with the heavy-lifting done in native code (i.e. C/C++), for example for physics rendering. 

The advantage of using *gdx2d* is that you can develop your code in Java on your standard desktop computer like any other Java application and then deploy the same code, with a single click, on an Android phone or tablet. Of course, you have to take into consideration the fact that some of your code is a bit different for Android (for instance, you do not have accelerometers on your PC). 

The library itself is a wrapper around a very very nice library called [http://code.google.com/libgdx libgdx] which provides almost everything to the library.
