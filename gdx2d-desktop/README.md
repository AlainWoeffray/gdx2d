## gdx2d-desktop

This project contains the library as well as all the demo programs. All the demos in this folder are destined to be run on desktop.

In order to run a demo, either use the `DemoSelector` class which provides a simple way to choose which demo to run. You can also run each demo, located in the `Demos` directory individually.
